# User-Retention-Conversion

The Jupyter Notebook contain analysis of user retention and conversion of "ping" data for an app within a month period. 
When the app is opened by a user, the app pings the analytics system. A user may ping multiple times in a day.
I compute the daily retention and conversion curve and which traffic sources the app get its best users.
